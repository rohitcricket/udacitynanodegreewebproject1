This is a resubmission of the project version 1. 

I am still not sure what to do since I am doing project 1 version 1 and not the version 2. So the auto evaluator, like the instructor you said, should not apply. Nevertheless, I have removed all external references to pass. I don't whether it will work. Please let me know if there is a problem.
